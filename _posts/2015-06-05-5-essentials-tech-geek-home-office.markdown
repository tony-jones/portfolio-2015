  <p>For many who work in technology, their job includes some working from home. An organized and efficient workspace can improve productivity and reduce distractions. Having physical and virtual tools ready and available is a must in the&nbsp;home office.</p>
  <p>Whether you are a freelancer, entrepreneur or occasional remote employee, this list of my top five essentials will be sure to help you maintain focus, relax your mind and improve your efficiency.</p>

    <h4 class="light grey-text text-darken-1">Desk Toys: For &nbsp;The Kid In All of Us</h4>
    <p>Engaging with things in the physical world is a great way to reduce stress and improve our cognitive functions. Desktop distractions give our brains short breaks which ultimately improve our focus. Toys such as magnetic wood blocks, stress balls, or a mini Tower of Hanoi game are great ways to fidget during the day.</p>

    <h4 class="light grey-text text-darken-1">Chair: Good&nbsp;Ergonomics is Key</h4>
    <p>Most people find that back pain increases when they work from their home office, which means that we’ve got a bit of a problem and we’re pretty sure it’s the chair.</p>
    <p>A well-made chair should provide proper pelvic and lumbar support which results in your back muscles being less stressed.</p>
    <p>I have been using the Leap Chair by Steelcase and I highly recommend it. I had lower back pains at the end of every day and discomfort. This chair provided the support I needed and made sitting at my desk more pleasant.</p>

    <h4 class="light grey-text text-darken-1">Desk: Benefits of a Standing Desk</h4>
    <p>The American Cancer Society did a study with 123,000 people for an 18-year period and found the death rate was higher in people that sat more than six hours per day.</p>
    <p>In another study with over 200,000 participants, researchers noted that even active people (those who exercised for at least five hours a week) had an increased risk of death if they sat longer. There was even one test done by a company that showed standing desks improved productivity by up to ten percent.</p>
    <p>Giving a standing desk, a try is a must. It will be difficult at first to get used to being on your feet for long periods of time, but you will be able to work your way up to standing for hours at a time.</p>

  <div id="stands" class="section scrollspy">
    <h4 class="light grey-text text-darken-1">Stands</h4>
    <p>Another key to good ergonomics is alignment. Having the top of your monitor aligned with your eyes, your arms at a 90 degree angle going to your keyboard, or your wrist being comfortably rested above your mouse are all elements having to do with the height of things on your desk.</p>
    <p>My favorite desk accessories company(Grovemade) has quite the assortment of stand and accessories. Go check them out at <a class="anchor" href="http://www.grovemade.com">www.grovemade.com</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Plants</strong><br>
    We have all read about the health benefits, focus improvements, and productivity studies on having plants in the office. While it is good to have a variety of plants, I recommend including some aesthetically beautiful plants to add to your decor like air plants.</p>
    <p>Try browsing the air plants/plant holder sections of Etsy. You will find some awesome plants for your workspace!</p>

    <p><strong>Art</strong><br>
    Wall art is one of my favorite things to have in the office because it brings a creative boost to your space. We all(designers especially) run into creative blocks, but having art can help keep the creative juices flowing.</p>
    <p>While there are many good art sources, I would be remiss if I didn’t shamelessly plug my own company <a class="anchor" href="http://www.pynecones.com">Pynecones</a>. We just recently launched and are still signing on&nbsp;new artist, but many of my personal designs are also on the site for sale under “Tony Bagels”. Check them out!</p>
