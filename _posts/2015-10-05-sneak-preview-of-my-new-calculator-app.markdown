<div class="flow-text" itemprop="articleBody">
<p>Recently, I was paying bills and realized that most calculator apps are either annoying or lack features that I desire. I spent last weekend building my own calculator and after using it for a few days, I decided to release it for free on iOS and Android.</p>
<h4 class="light grey-text text-darken-1">The Challenge</h4>
<p>Here is my list of features and functionality that were priorities for building this app.</p>
<p><strong>Keep a Tally of Calculations</strong><br>
This was the most important feature for me and one that is missing in many calculators. I was paying bills, so I needed to look back in history and see what I had entered.</p>
<p><strong>Undo Button for Correcting Mistakes</strong><br>
Everyone knows the feeling of entering a long equation into a calculator, only to hit the wrong key and have to start all over again. This feature may actually be tied for most important.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Scientific Stuff Hidden</strong><br>
The scientific functions are optionally turned on in the options menu, so they don’t take up space from the basic calculator features that are most frequently used.</p>
<p><strong>User Tests on the Button Layout</strong><br>
I have no idea why most calculator app layouts don’t match telephone layouts. Phone layouts feel more natural and easier to use. I decided to user test different layouts and gather data from users before deciding on the best layout.</p>
<p><strong>Color Palette</strong><br>
Just using basic color theory and psychology here. Also, checking contrast ratios for accessibility concerns.</p>
<p>Below is the sneak preview of the application. If you have any question on technology just send me and email. Dev stack: Ionic Framework, Vanilla CSS/JavaScript/HTML, and as few lines of code as possible.</p>

<h4 class="light grey-text text-darken-1">Moving Forward</h4>
<p>I completed development on the app, but I don’t have a release date yet. I will probably do another few weeks of testing before releasing. Check back to my blog in a few weeks for an update!</p>
